# Description

Hey Tray.io, it was an exciting task that took me 2.5 hours to complete. To build a framework and write the first test, I used Typescript, WebDriver.io, Mocha, Chai, and Node.js in accordance with the task requirements. One thing to note is that Java is my primary language, and this is my first time creating a testing framework with webdriver.io, so there may be room for improvement.
